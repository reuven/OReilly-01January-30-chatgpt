# Data from my "Pair Programming with ChatGPT" course

This repo contains the Jupyter notebook + program files from my training for O'Reilly in November 2023.  It'll remain open, so you can review the material later on. Also, I'll add the conversations from ChatGPT, so you can review those, as well.

The transcript from our ChatGPT session is here: https://chat.openai.com/share/9729d6d3-3f26-404a-af1a-1729eab0fca2

Enjoy!
