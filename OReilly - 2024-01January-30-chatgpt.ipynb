Pair programming is all about improving how the coding happens, both the process of the coding and the validation of what you've written by having two people work on a single computer.\n",

    "# What is ChatGPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM). The idea is that if you train a machine-learning model, it'll see patterns. A model doesn't store everything it learned, and then look up those images/texts to pull out a match. Rather, it learns the contours of what each category can mean and be, and then tries to make a good guess when we show it a new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT it's known as \"generative\" AI, where it uses those patterns that it has learned to come up with new things. If, 100% of the time two words follow each other (\"foo bar\"), then if you ask ChatGPT to produce some text about \"foo\", it'll 100% of the time produce something that says \"Foo bar.\" But most words aren't 100% following each other, and so it's a matter of statistical likeliness.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we ask ChatGPT to write text or code or even create an image... it'll never create the same thing twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that we can use ChatGPT to do a bunch of different things having to do with coding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write code\n",
    "- Analyze code\n",
