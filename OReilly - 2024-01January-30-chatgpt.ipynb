Pair programming is all about improving how the coding happens, both the process of the coding and the validation of what you've written by having two people work on a single computer.\n",

    "# What is ChatGPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM). The idea is that if you train a machine-learning model, it'll see patterns. A model doesn't store everything it learned, and then look up those images/texts to pull out a match. Rather, it learns the contours of what each category can mean and be, and then tries to make a good guess when we show it a new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT it's known as \"generative\" AI, where it uses those patterns that it has learned to come up with new things. If, 100% of the time two words follow each other (\"foo bar\"), then if you ask ChatGPT to produce some text about \"foo\", it'll 100% of the time produce something that says \"Foo bar.\" But most words aren't 100% following each other, and so it's a matter of statistical likeliness.\n",

    "If we ask ChatGPT to write text or code or even create an image... it'll never create the same thing twice.\n",
